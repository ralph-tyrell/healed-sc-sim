#These is the collection of the main computational work I did during my summer as a fellow at the Summer Undergraduate Research Program at the Simons Center for Computational Physical Chemistry at NYU.
#The clean_diosi.py file is the sum of previous efforts to implement the proposed "Ehrenfest" Langevin equations into a chemical mixed quantum-classical system.  It imports certain functions from the function_keeper.py file.  There are some redundant functions within this file, between the two files (e.g. coef_calculator) as I found them to be particularly buggy and I felt as though there was not a large gain between debugging it.
