This is the collection of the main computational work I did during my summer as a fellow at the Summer Undergraduate Research Program at the Simons Center for Computational Physical Chemistry at NYU.
The clean_diosi.py file is the sum of previous efforts to implement the proposed "Ehrenfest" Langevin equations into a chemical mixed quantum-classical system.  It imports certain functions from the function_keeper.py file.  There are some redundant functions within this file, between the two files (e.g. coef_calculator) as I found them to be particularly buggy and I felt as though there was not a large gain between debugging it.
Other files include traject.py, which was one of the first simulations I conducted.  It helped me understand how to simulate classical dynamics. The final_diosi.py was the implementation of the methods described in _A healthier semi-classical dynamics_ showing that with the addition of stochastic noise a quantum particle ultimately "chooses" a quantum state.
The schrodinger_function.py file shows a simulation of a time independent Hamiltonian, while the tdhamiltonian.py shows the evolution of a time dependent Hamiltonian would evolve.  The latter originally showed a near perfect convergence with the analytical result, but was used in the future to test questions posed about the final project.
